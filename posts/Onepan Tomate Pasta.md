Season the chicken as desired. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until well browned, stirring often. Remove the chicken from the skillet.

Add the onion to the skillet and cook until tender-crisp, stirring occasionally. Add the wine and heat to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

Stir in the tomatoes, Swanson Chicken Broth, penne, and water; heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook for 10 minutes or until the penne is tender, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Stir in the spinach and cook for 1 minute or until the spinach is wilted.
